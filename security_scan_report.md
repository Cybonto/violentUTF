## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/core/auth.py`
**Line Range:** 1-278

**Strengths:**
- Implements comprehensive JWT token validation with signature verification
- Supports both JWT and API key authentication methods
- Includes APISIX gateway verification with HMAC signature validation
- Proper role-based and permission-based access control
- Comprehensive input sanitization and validation

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Medium Risk:** APISIX gateway verification relies on easily spoofable headers (lines 73-85)
- **Low Risk:** JWT token validation could be enhanced with additional claims validation

**Recommendations:**
- Implement stronger APISIX gateway verification using mutual TLS or stronger cryptographic proofs
- Add additional JWT claims validation (audience, issuer verification)
- Consider implementing token blacklisting for revoked tokens

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/core/validation.py`
**Line Range:** 1-486

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive input validation with security-focused limits
- Proper string sanitization removing control characters
- URL validation with SSRF protection
- JSON data validation with depth limits
- File upload validation with type restrictions

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Medium Risk:** Regex patterns could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks
- **Low Risk:** Some validation limits may be too permissive for production use

**Recommendations:**
- Review regex patterns for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities
- Consider implementing stricter validation limits for production environments
- Add content-based file validation in addition to extension validation

### 3. Database Security

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/db/duckdb_manager.py`
**Line Range:** 1-500+

**Strengths:**
- Uses parameterized queries consistently throughout
- Implements table name whitelisting for dynamic queries
- Proper column name validation for UPDATE operations
- User-based database isolation with salted hashing

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Medium Risk:** Limited SQL injection protection in formatted queries (line 210)
- **Low Risk:** Database connection pooling could be improved

**Recommendations:**
- Replace formatted queries with parameterized alternatives where possible
- Implement database connection pooling and proper connection lifecycle management
- Add database query logging for security monitoring

### 4. File Upload Security

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/api/endpoints/files.py`
**Line Range:** 1-150+

**Strengths:**
- Generates unique file IDs to prevent conflicts
- Implements user-specific file directories
- Saves metadata separately from file content

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **High Risk:** Potential path traversal in file operations (lines 58-59)
- **Medium Risk:** Missing file content validation beyond extension
- **Low Risk:** No file size limits enforced

**Recommendations:**
- Implement strict filename sanitization to prevent path traversal
- Add content-based file type validation (magic number checking)
- Implement file size limits and virus scanning
- Use secure file storage with proper access controls

### 5. Configuration Security

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/core/config.py`
**Line Range:** 1-200+

**Strengths:**
- Uses environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implements proper default values for development
- Comprehensive configuration validation

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Medium Risk:** Some default values may be insecure for production
- **Low Risk:** Missing validation for some configuration parameters

**Recommendations:**
- Implement configuration validation for all sensitive parameters
- Remove or secure default values for production deployment
- Add configuration change logging and monitoring

### 6. Shell Script Security

**Files:** Multiple shell scripts throughout the project

**Strengths:**
- Uses proper error handling with `set -e`
- Implements user input validation in many scripts
- Proper quoting of variables in most cases

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **High Risk:** Potential command injection in dynamic script execution
- **Medium Risk:** Use of `curl` without proper SSL verification in some scripts
- **Low Risk:** Missing input validation in some utility scripts

**Recommendations:**
- Implement strict input validation for all shell scripts
- Use proper SSL verification for all network operations
- Consider replacing shell scripts with more secure alternatives where possible

### 7. Cryptographic Security

**File:** `/violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/core/security.py`
**Line Range:** 1-294

**Strengths:**
- Uses bcrypt for password hashing with proper configuration
- Implements secure JWT token generation and validation
- Proper random number generation for token creation

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Low Risk:** JWT algorithm validation could be more restrictive
- **Low Risk:** Password policy could be more stringent

**Recommendations:**
- Restrict JWT algorithms to only the most secure options
