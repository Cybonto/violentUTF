- Provided examples for each level
- Explained use cases (CI/CD, troubleshooting, etc.)

### 3. Platform Parity
- Linux setup now matches macOS features
- Consistent command structure across platforms
- Platform-specific considerations documented

### 4. Modular Architecture
- Explained benefits of modular design
- Documented module locations
- Provided debugging guidance

## User Impact

### For New Users

- Preservation of existing credentials
- No disruption to workflows

### For Developers
- Modular architecture documentation
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Debugging and troubleshooting resources

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Setup with credential preservation
./setup_macos_new.sh              # macOS
sudo ./setup_linux_new.sh         # Linux

# Cleanup (preserves credentials)
./setup_macos_new.sh --cleanup
sudo ./setup_linux_new.sh --cleanup

# Dashboard cleanup only
./setup_macos_new.sh --cleanup-dashboard
sudo ./setup_linux_new.sh --cleanup-dashboard

# Complete reset
./setup_macos_new.sh --deepcleanup
sudo ./setup_linux_new.sh --deepcleanup
```
