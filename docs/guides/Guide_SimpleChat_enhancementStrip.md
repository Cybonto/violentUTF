- Each variation includes its type and purpose
- Click "Use This Variation" to test specific scenarios

## Integration with Existing Features

### Prompt Variables
- Enhanced prompts can be saved as prompt variables
- Use the "Create Prompt Variable" buttons as before
- Variables work seamlessly with MCP enhancements

### AI Gateway Integration
- MCP features work with all AI Gateway providers
- Security plugins (Prompt Guard, Decorator) remain active
- Enhanced prompts respect existing security policies

## Best Practices

### For Prompt Enhancement
1. Start with a clear, basic prompt
2. Use enhancement to add structure and context
3. Review suggested improvements before using
4. Save effective enhancements as variables

### For Security Testing
1. Always analyze prompts before production use
2. Test variations against your target model
3. Address identified vulnerabilities
4. Use quick actions for rapid assessment

### For Bias Detection
1. Check all user-facing prompts for bias
2. Pay attention to demographic categories
3. Test with diverse scenarios
4. Iterate based on analysis results

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Connection Issues
- Ensure ViolentUTF API is running
- Check JWT authentication is valid
- Verify APISIX gateway is accessible
- Look for error messages in the UI

### No Enhancement Available
- Some prompts may not have MCP enhancements
- Fallback enhancements will be provided
- Check available MCP prompts in server logs

### Slow Response Times
- MCP operations may take a few seconds
- Loading spinners indicate processing
- Performance depends on server load
- Consider caching frequently used enhancements

## Advanced Features

### Natural Language Commands (Coming in Phase 3)
- Use `/mcp enhance` directly in prompts
- Natural language configuration requests
- Command autocomplete suggestions

### Context-Aware Assistance (Coming in Phase 4)
- Automatic enhancement suggestions
- Real-time security monitoring
- Conversation context analysis

### Visual Builders (Coming in Phase 5)
- Drag-and-drop prompt construction
- Template library integration
- A/B testing support

## Security Considerations

- All MCP operations require authentication
- Enhanced prompts are not automatically saved
- Analysis results are session-specific
- No sensitive data is sent to external services
