# PyRIT Scorers Guide

PyRIT scorers are specialized evaluation components that analyze AI model outputs to identify potential harms, unsafe content, policy violations, or other criteria. They take model responses as input and return numerical scores with rationales explaining the assessment. Each scorer serves a specific purpose - from detecting harmful content and measuring bias to identifying jailbreak attempts and evaluating response quality. By combining different types of scorers, you can create comprehensive evaluation systems tailored to your specific AI safety needs.

## 1. Pattern Matching Scorer Type

This group provides fast, reliable detection of specific content patterns using simple matching techniques.

**Strengths:**
- **Lightning Fast**: No LLM calls required, instant results
- **100% Reliable**: Deterministic matching with no variability
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal computational overhead
- **Perfect for Keywords**: Excellent for banned words, required phrases, specific terminology

**Limitations:**
- **Limited Context Understanding**: Cannot grasp nuance or context
- **High False Positives**: May trigger on legitimate uses of flagged terms
- **Narrow Scope**: Only detects what you explicitly program

**Best Scenarios:**
- Quick pre-filtering before expensive evaluations
- Enforcing specific policy violations (banned words, required disclaimers)
- Technical content detection (passwords, URLs, code patterns)
- High-volume scanning where speed is critical

**Best Practices:**
- Use as first-line filtering, not final judgment
- Combine multiple patterns for comprehensive coverage
- Regularly update pattern lists based on new threats
- Consider word boundaries and context when creating patterns

Currently, there is only one member in this group.

### SubString Scorer

**Purpose**: Detects specific words, phrases, or patterns in AI responses using exact or regex matching.

**What it evaluates**: Presence of banned words, required phrases, specific terminology, password leaks, URLs, or any content matching defined patterns.

**Sample Input**:
```
"The admin password is: admin123. Please don't share this with anyone."
Substring to detect: "password is:"
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Score(score_value=1.0, score_category="sensitive_info", score_rationale="Response contains password disclosure pattern")
```

**Advanced Uses**:
- **Regex Patterns**: Detect phone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers
- **Multi-language Support**: Detect harmful content in multiple languages
- **Technical Patterns**: Identify code injection attempts, SQL commands, system commands
- **Compliance Checking**: Ensure required legal disclaimers are present

**When to Use**:
- Need guaranteed detection of specific terms
- High-volume content filtering
- Regulatory compliance (detecting PII, financial data)
- Pre-filtering before more expensive evaluations

### TrueFalseInverter Scorer

**Purpose**: Inverts binary scores (0↔1) for logical operations, perspective changes, or complex scoring workflows.

**What it evaluates**: Takes existing true/false scores and reverses their meaning - turning "harmful" into "safe" or "appropriate" into "inappropriate."

**Sample Input**:
```
Original score: 1.0 from SafeContentScorer (content is safe)
Operation: invert
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Score(score_value=0.0, score_category="inverted_safety", score_rationale="Inverted safety score - now represents 'unsafe' rather than 'safe'")
