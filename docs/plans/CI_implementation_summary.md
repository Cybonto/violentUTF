- pip-audit for additional checks
- Trivy for container scanning
- Semgrep for comprehensive analysis (nightly)

### ✅ Code Quality
- Black formatting validation
- isort import sorting
- flake8 linting
- mypy type checking
- Complexity analysis with radon

### ✅ Docker Integration
- Docker-in-Docker (DinD) setup
- Service health checks
- Network connectivity validation
- Container log collection

### ✅ Developer Experience
- PR comments with results
- Debug mode with tmate
- Automatic formatting suggestions
- Clear error reporting

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Action Pinning**: All actions pinned to specific SHA commits
2. **Minimal Permissions**: Least privilege principle
3. **Secret Management**: No hardcoded credentials
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Multiple layers of security checks
5. **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive artifact generation

## Integration with ViolentUTF Architecture

- **APISIX Gateway**: Health check validation
- **Keycloak SSO**: Authentication testing
- **PyRIT/Garak**: Framework compatibility checks
- **MCP Server**: Integration testing support
- **Docker Services**: Complete stack validation

## Performance Optimizations

- Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Intelligent caching for dependencies
- Concurrency controls to prevent duplicate runs
- Artifact retention policies

## Next Steps

The CI workflow implementation is complete and ready for use. Teams can now:

1. Submit PRs to trigger automated validation
2. Monitor nightly runs for comprehensive testing
3. Review security scan results in GitHub Security tab
4. Use debug mode for troubleshooting failures
