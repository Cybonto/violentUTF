## 2. High-Level Improvement Overview

### 2.1 Operational Hierarchy Clarity

**Vision**: Create clear distinction between Test Runs, Batch Operations, and Score Results

**Current Problem**: Users see "Total Executions: 47" without understanding if these are test runs or individual batches within runs.

**Solution Approach**:
```
🎯 Test Executions: 3 runs (your actual security test campaigns)
📦 Batch Operations: 15 batches (processing segments within runs)
📊 Score Results: 847 scores (individual security assessments)
⚡ Completion Rate: 98.2% (operational efficiency metric)
```

**Value**: Security teams gain immediate understanding of their testing scale and operational efficiency.

### 2.2 Dynamic Situational Intelligence

**Vision**: Transform static metrics into dynamic, question-answering intelligence

**Key Questions Enabled**:
- "How secure are our GPT-4 deployments against financial fraud scenarios?"
- "Which datasets reveal the most vulnerabilities in our production models?"
- "Are our defenses improving or degrading over time?"

**Solution Approach**: 
- **Smart Filters**: Execution, Dataset, Generator, Scorer, Time Range
- **Comparison Mode**: Filtered vs Baseline metrics
- **Quick Presets**: "Last 24 hours", "Production Models", "High-Risk Scenarios"
- **Saved Views**: Share specific filter combinations across teams

**Value**: Transform from "looking at data" to "answering critical security questions".

### 2.3 Multi-Dimensional Intelligence Matrix

**Vision**: Reveal hidden relationships and patterns in security testing

**Current State**: "SelfHarmScorer found 23 violations"

**Future State**: 
```
SelfHarmScorer Performance Matrix:
- GPT-4: 85% detection rate (trending ↑)
- Claude: 60% detection rate (stable)  
- Llama2: 23% detection rate (trending ↓)
- Most effective on: Creative writing datasets
- Least effective on: Technical documentation
- Performance trend: -15% this week (investigate)
```

**Value**: Move from counting problems to understanding vulnerability patterns.

### 2.4 Operational Readiness vs Complex Analytics

**Vision**: Replace complex temporal analysis with immediate operational insights

**Out (Move to Advanced Dashboard)**:
- Statistical time-series analysis
- Complex hourly pattern detection
- Academic-style trend analysis

**In (Operational Readiness Tab)**:
- **Recent Activity Monitor**: "Last 4 hours: 12 tests, 3 critical findings"
- **Active Security Alerts**: "⚠️ Unusual violation spike in GPT-4"
- **Quick Actions Panel**: Direct links to rerun tests, adjust configurations
- **Shift Handoff Summary**: Key findings and actions for incoming team

**Value**: Focus on "what do I need to know and do right now" vs deep analysis.

### 2.5 Evidence-Based Security Intelligence

**Vision**: Enable teams to validate findings with actual AI conversations

**Current Limitation**: "Trust the score without seeing the evidence"

**Solution Features**:
- **Prompt-Response Viewer**: See exact conversations that triggered violations
- **Attack Pattern Library**: Group similar successful attacks
- **Response Analysis**: Understand how models fail or succeed
- **Evidence Export**: Package examples for training and reporting

**Interactive Capabilities**:
```
Search: "Show all responses mentioning 'password'"
Filter: "Responses scored as critical by multiple scorers"
Group: "Cluster similar jailbreak attempts"
Export: "Generate evidence report for compliance"
```

**Value**: Transform from "the system says it's bad" to "here's exactly what happened and why".

## 3. Detailed Implementation Specifications

### 3.1 Execution Counting Enhancement

#### 3.1.1 The Execution Hierarchy Problem

**Current Understanding**:
The system currently counts unique execution IDs correctly, but the presentation doesn't clearly communicate the hierarchical nature of test operations. Users need to understand:
- A **Test Execution** is a complete security testing campaign
- Each execution may process data in multiple **Batches** for efficiency
- Each batch generates multiple **Scores** from different security scorers

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. The data structure includes `batch_index` and `total_batches` in metadata
2. The UI only shows a flat "Total Executions" count
3. Users can't distinguish between 3 large test runs vs 30 small ones
4. Operational efficiency metrics are missing

#### 3.1.2 Hierarchical Metrics Algorithm

**Data Processing Steps**:
1. **Group Phase**: Aggregate all results by execution_id
2. **Batch Detection**: Within each execution, identify unique batch combinations using (batch_index, total_batches) tuples
3. **Completion Calculation**: For each execution, calculate completed_batches/total_batches ratio
4. **Aggregation Phase**: Roll up metrics hierarchically

**Key Metrics to Calculate**:
- **Test Runs**: Count of unique execution IDs
- **Total Batches**: Sum of unique batch tuples across all executions
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of batches that reached their expected total
- **Average Batches per Run**: Distribution insight
- **Average Scores per Batch**: Density insight
- **Execution Duration**: Time from first to last score in execution
- **Throughput**: Scores processed per minute

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
- Missing batch metadata (assume single batch)
- Incomplete executions (show partial completion)
- Concurrent executions (separate tracking)
- Failed batches (identify and highlight)

#### 3.1.3 UI Presentation Strategy

**Primary Metrics Row Design**:
- Use hierarchical icons (🎯→📦→📊) to show relationship
- Add contextual tooltips explaining each level
- Show delta calculations (e.g., "~5 batches per run")
- Use color coding for completion rates (green >95%, yellow 80-95%, red <80%)

**Drill-Down Capability**:
- Click on "Test Runs" to see execution list
- Click on "Batches" to see batch distribution
- Click on "Scores" to see score type breakdown

**Visual Hierarchy Diagram**:
Create an interactive tree diagram showing:
- Root: Total Operations
- Level 1: Individual Test Runs
- Level 2: Batches within each run
- Level 3: Scores within each batch

### 3.2 Dynamic Filtering System

- Time zone awareness for global teams

**Layer 2 - Entity-Based Filtering**:

- **Scorers**: Filter by type, category, effectiveness rating

**Layer 3 - Result-Based Filtering**:

2. **Filter Preview**: Show result count before applying
3. **Filter History**: Remember last 10 filter combinations
4. **Quick Clear**: Individual filter reset without losing others
5. **Filter Templates**: Pre-built filters for common scenarios

**Performance Considerations**:
- Client-side filtering for <1000 results
