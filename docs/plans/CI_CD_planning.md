## Sub-Issue Analysis and Implementation Plan

### 1. Initialize Continuous Integration Workflow

**Objective**: Establish automated testing, building, and quality checks for every pull request and commit.

#### Core Workflow Architecture

The continuous integration workflow will serve as the foundation for all automated quality assurance and security validation. Every code change will trigger a comprehensive validation pipeline that ensures code quality, security compliance, and functional correctness before any merge operations.

#### Multi-Platform Testing Strategy

The CI system will execute tests across multiple operating system environments with direct alignment to Docker container deployment architectures. Ubuntu runners will serve as the primary testing environment for AMD64 container validation, ensuring comprehensive compatibility with the most common deployment target. These runners will validate both development setup scripts and containerized deployment scenarios.

macOS runners will specifically validate Apple Silicon (ARM64) compatibility, including both local development on Apple hardware and ARM64 container functionality. This ensures that the multi-architecture Docker builds work correctly on ARM64 targets and that development teams can work effectively on Apple Silicon machines.

Windows runners will validate enterprise Windows development environments and validate cross-compilation scenarios for Linux container deployment. This testing ensures that development teams on Windows can effectively build and test Linux containers that will be deployed in production.

Each platform testing matrix will be coordinated with the Docker publishing workflow's target architectures: Ubuntu/Linux runners validate AMD64 containers, macOS runners validate ARM64 containers, and Windows runners validate cross-platform development workflows. Container functionality testing will use the same base images produced by the Docker publishing workflow to ensure perfect consistency between CI validation and production deployment.

#### Python Version Compatibility Matrix

The workflow will test against multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility with the PyRIT and Garak frameworks' requirements. Python 3.10 will serve as the minimum supported version, with testing extending through Python 3.12 to ensure forward compatibility. Each Python version will be tested with the complete dependency stack to identify version-specific issues early.

The matrix testing approach will validate that all required packages install correctly, that there are no version conflicts between PyRIT, Garak, and other dependencies, and that the application functions identically across all supported Python versions. Special attention will be paid to ensuring that the AI frameworks maintain their security testing capabilities across all Python versions.

#### Service Integration and Container Testing

The CI workflow will establish a complete ViolentUTF environment using coordinated Docker container orchestration that integrates with the Docker publishing workflow. This approach uses Docker-in-Docker (DinD) with resource isolation to prevent conflicts between CI testing containers and production image building processes.

The testing environment will utilize pre-built base images from the Docker publishing workflow when available, ensuring consistency between testing and production environments. This includes spinning up the APISIX gateway with proper routing configuration, initializing Keycloak with the test realm and user accounts, starting the FastAPI service with all endpoints enabled, and launching the Streamlit application with authentication enabled.

The integration testing will verify that all services can communicate through the Docker network, that authentication flows work correctly from Keycloak through APISIX to the backend services, that API endpoints respond correctly when accessed through the gateway, and that the MCP server functions properly with all tools and prompts available.

Container resource management will implement priority scheduling where CI testing takes precedence over image building during active pull request validation, while image publishing gets priority during release workflows. Shared Docker layer caching will be coordinated between workflows to maximize efficiency while preventing cache corruption.

#### Test Execution and Orchestration

The existing comprehensive test suite will be adapted for CI execution with proper environment setup and teardown. The workflow will execute the main test runner script while capturing detailed output and generating proper exit codes for CI interpretation. Test results will be parsed and formatted for GitHub's test reporting interface, with clear indication of passed, failed, and skipped tests.

Parallel test execution will be implemented where possible to reduce CI runtime, with careful coordination to avoid conflicts in shared resources like databases or file systems. Test isolation will ensure that failures in one test category don't cascade to others, and proper cleanup will prevent test pollution between runs.

#### Code Quality and Standards Enforcement

Automated code quality checks will enforce consistent coding standards across the entire codebase. Python code formatting will be validated using Black with the project's configuration settings, ensuring consistent style across all Python files. Import organization will be checked using isort to maintain clean and logical import statements.

Linting will be performed using flake8 with custom rules appropriate for security-focused applications, identifying potential code issues, style violations, and maintainability concerns. Type checking will be implemented using mypy to catch type-related errors early and improve code reliability, with special attention to the complex type interactions in PyRIT and Garak integrations.

Documentation quality will be validated by checking that all public functions and classes have appropriate docstrings, that inline comments are meaningful and up-to-date, and that code complexity metrics remain within acceptable bounds.

#### Dependency Management and Security

The workflow will implement comprehensive dependency management with coordinated security validation that integrates with the Docker publishing workflow's security scanning. Dependency installation will use pip with hash verification to ensure package integrity, and dependency caching will be shared between CI and Docker build processes to maintain consistency.

Source-level security scanning will focus on dependency vulnerabilities, license compliance, and secrets detection during the CI phase. All dependencies will be scanned for known vulnerabilities before installation, with automatic failure if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected. This creates the first layer of security validation that feeds into the Docker publishing workflow.

Container-level security scanning will then validate the complete runtime environment, including base image vulnerabilities, configuration security, and final image composition. This layered approach ensures comprehensive coverage without duplication - CI catches source and dependency issues, while Docker publishing validates the complete deployment artifact.

Vulnerability findings will be correlated between workflows to provide unified reporting and prevent conflicts where different scanning tools might report the same issues differently. The workflow will also validate that the ai-tokens.env.sample file is kept up-to-date with any new AI provider integrations, and that the requirements.txt files accurately reflect the actual dependencies used by the application.

#### Artifact Generation and Preservation

The CI workflow will generate and preserve important artifacts that integrate with the Docker publishing workflow's artifact strategy. Test coverage reports, security scan results, and build logs will be linked to specific container image builds through metadata correlation, providing complete traceability from source validation to deployment artifacts.

CI artifacts will include test coverage reports, static analysis results, security scan findings, and performance benchmarks. These artifacts will be preserved with retention policies that align with container image retention, ensuring that diagnostic information remains available as long as the corresponding container images exist.

Container publishing artifacts will include signed images, security scan reports, and build metadata. The artifact relationship mapping will enable users to trace any container image back to its CI validation results, providing comprehensive audit trails and debugging capabilities. Artifact storage will be coordinated to prevent duplication while ensuring accessibility across both workflow types.

#### Error Handling and Notification

Comprehensive error handling will ensure that CI failures provide actionable information for developers. Test failures will include detailed stack traces, environment information, and suggestions for local reproduction. Build failures will capture complete build logs with clear indication of the failure point.

Notification strategies will alert appropriate team members of CI failures while avoiding notification fatigue. Critical failures that affect security or core functionality will receive immediate attention, while minor failures may be batched for regular review.

**Security Considerations**:
- Pin all GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs (not version tags)
- Use minimal permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN
- Implement secure secret management for AI provider tokens
- Scan for hardcoded credentials and secrets
