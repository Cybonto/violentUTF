**Parent Plan**: CI_CD_planning.md
**Section**: 1. Initialize Continuous Integration Workflow
**Created**: December 28, 2024
**Updated**: December 29, 2024 - Added three-tier optimization strategy
**Status**: Implementation Ready

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for establishing an optimized continuous integration workflow for ViolentUTF. The implementation uses a three-tier testing strategy to provide fast feedback for developers while maintaining comprehensive quality assurance for production code.

## Prerequisites

### Repository Setup
- Confirm current branch is `dev_tests` (as per CLAUDE.md restrictions)
- Ensure `.github/workflows/` directory creation is permitted
- Validate access to GitHub Actions and required permissions
- Verify Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry access

### Environment Preparation
- Collect list of required GitHub Secrets for AI provider tokens
- Identify all Python package dependencies across both applications
- Document current test execution patterns and requirements
- Map existing Docker service dependencies and startup sequences

## Three-Tier Optimization Strategy

### Current Issues
1. **Resource Intensive**: 12 parallel jobs (3 OS × 4 Python versions) on every push
2. **Slow Feedback**: Developers wait 20-30 minutes for results
3. **Frequent Failures**: Cache service 503 errors, transient test failures
4. **Blocking Issues**: Code quality failures prevent all other tests from providing value

### Proposed Architecture

#### Tier 1: Quick Development Checks (dev_* branches)
**Runtime**: 5-10 minutes
**Triggers**: Push to dev_* branches
- Code formatting (black, isort)
- Critical linting (flake8 - E9, F63, F7, F82 errors only)
- High-severity security scan (bandit -ll)
- Core unit tests (pytest tests/unit/)
- Single environment (Ubuntu + Python 3.11)

#### Tier 2: Pull Request Validation
**Runtime**: 15-20 minutes
**Triggers**: Pull requests to main/develop
- Comprehensive code quality checks
- Full security scans (all severity levels)
- Reduced test matrix (Ubuntu/Windows × Python 3.10/3.11)
- API contract tests
- Integration tests with Docker services

#### Tier 3: Full Matrix Testing
**Runtime**: 20-30 minutes
**Triggers**: Push to main, release tags, nightly schedule, [full-ci] flag
- Complete test matrix (3 OS × 4 Python versions)
- Comprehensive security scanning (Semgrep, pip-audit)
- Full integration testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Docker image builds
