# Generalized Database Audit and Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document provides a robust, generalized, and customizable framework for conducting routine database audits and continuous improvement applicable to any complex software system, not only ViolentUTF. The plan is designed to work for systems with multi-layered architectures, varied data stores, APIs, GUIs, and distributed services, supporting both initial establishment and ongoing change management.

---

## Phase 0: Architecture Identification
### **Objective:**
Capture an accurate, up-to-date blueprint of the system's architecture as a foundation for all audit work.

### **Steps:**
1. **Sources to Inspect:**
   - System architecture documents (e.g., in /docs, wiki pages)
   - Project root README, ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and design docs
   - Source code (for implementation-located configs and modules)
   - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC): Terraform, Ansible, Docker Compose, etc.
   - Dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, etc.)
   - CI/CD pipeline definitions
   - Configuration files (YAML, JSON, XML, ENV variables)
2. **Extract:**
   - Major system components (APIs, frontends, batch jobs, workers, data sources, etc.)
   - Data stores (databases, message queues, caches, filesystems, cloud buckets)
   - Interaction flows (which component talks to which, how data moves)
   - External integrations (SaaS, APIs, 3rd-party auth, cloud services)
3. **Tools:**
   - Use auto-documentation tools if available (e.g., Swagger for APIs, PlantUML for diagrams)
   - For legacy or undocumented systems: generate call graphs, use static analysis, or scan codebase for connection strings and credentials
4. **Artifacts to Produce:**
   - Logical architecture diagrams (component, deployment, and data flow)
   - Catalog of all data stores and their primary use (chart/table)
   - List of critical architectural decisions and trade-offs (summarized from ADRs or write new ones as gaps are found)

## Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory
### **Objective:**
Build and continually update a complete inventory and status of all data assets, helping identify gaps/risks.

### **Steps:**
1. **Check Existing Inventory:**
   - Look for up-to-date CMDB (Configuration Management Database), inventory wikis, or asset lists in project management tools
   - Interview stakeholders and check onboarding docs for implicit assets
2. **Discovery Methods:**
   - Manual: Walk through codebase, config files, infrastructure docs, and network diagrams
   - Automated: Use asset discovery tools (Zluri, SolarWinds, ServiceNow, Lansweeper) to scan network, cloud, and application layers
   - Scripted: Write scripts to list all running instances, ports, and databases
   - Crawl backups, data lake, and data warehouse catalogs
3. **Inventory Contents:**
   - All physical and virtual data stores (e.g., databases, NoSQL, object storage, logs, etc.)
   - Data schemas and key datasets with ownership identified
   - Who/what has access, location, type, version, connection method, backup status
   - Inventory should be linked to a risk/status register (confidence, freshness, compliance)
4. **Gap Identification:**
   - Compare discovered assets with existing documentation
   - Flag orphaned or undocumented resources
   - Identify missing, outdated, or duplicated entries
   - Address gaps via stakeholder interviews, deep code audits, and extending automated scanning
5. **Artifacts:**
   - A living inventory register (use spreadsheets, CMDB/software tools, or Git-based Markdown logs)
   - Asset risk/status charts (e.g., heatmaps by compliance, backup, access, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Dependency Mapping
### **Objective:**
Comprehensively document all data, service, and application dependencies; understand and visualize risk/ripple effects.

### **Steps:**
1. **Gather Inputs:**
   - Codebase (search for imports, API calls, library use, connection strings)
   - IaC scripts, deployment manifests, API docs
   - Monitoring and log data (for runtime dependency discovery)
   - Interviews with devs/ops; review onboarding knowledge
2. **Discovery Approaches:**
   - Manual code review (for small projects or critical paths)
   - Tool-based analysis (e.g., Device42, ServiceNow, LogicMonitor for infra/app mapping; npm/yarn/pip for code deps)
   - Runtime tracing/monitoring (OpenTelemetry, APMs) for actual interaction and late-bound/runtime deps
3. **Document and Validate:**
   - Build diagrams (component dependency graphs, call flows, deployment maps)
   - For each dependency, record: type, direction, criticality, fallback/redundancy, maintainers, version lock policy
   - Review artifacts with team for omissions
4. **Artifacts:**
   - Up-to-date dependency matrix (table) showing all relationships
   - Annotated dependency graph (ideally auto-generated and kept current)
   - Change impact assessment template for use during major upgrades

---

## Phase 3: Configuration Review
### **Objective:**
Detect config drift, misconfiguration, and maintain baseline documentation of desired state.

### **Steps:**
1. **Locate Configurations:**
   - Identify all locations: files, environment variables, secret managers, IaC modules, API parameter services
   - Separate runtime, build-time, and secret configurations
2. **Review Contents:**
   - Use scripts/tools to check for missing/extra/undocumented parameters
   - Compare dev/staging/prod for consistency
   - Document all config with owner, scope, sensitivity, and update process
3. **Detect Drift:**
   - Set up configuration validation in CI/CD (linting, schema validation, diffs against desired state)
   - Periodically check for changes vs. baseline, alert if detected
   - Test for undocumented or unexpected changes (manual spot checks, auto-checks)
4. **Artifacts:**
   - Config baseline docs (in VCS)
   - Config change history and audit logs

---

## Phase 4: Backup & Recovery Review
### **Objective:**
Ensure all data stores and configs are protected with reliable, tested backup and restore processes.

### **Steps:**
1. **Identify Backup Coverage:**
   - Confirm each asset in the inventory has documented backup strategy (type, frequency, retention)
   - Cover all variants: full, incremental, snapshots, configuration/data separation
2. **Backup Process Validation:**
   - Check automation: cron jobs, CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native backup features
   - Confirm backup storage reliability and backup rotation/retention
   - Test for alerting on failures (failed jobs, missed schedules)
3. **Recovery Testing:**
   - Schedule restore drills (restore to sandbox/test env, bit-for-bit file checks)
   - Validate RPO/RTO objectives are being met under realistic scenarios
   - Record test results and address found weaknesses
4. **Gap/Fault Addressing:**
   - Investigate failed restore scenarios (file corruption, access denial, missing dependencies) and adjust runbooks
   - Document and remedy coverage gaps
5. **Artifacts:**
   - Backup topology diagrams and process docs
   - Recorded outcomes of restore tests and improvement action tracker

## Phase 5: Performance & Health Monitoring
### **Objective:**
Maintain optimal performance, detect slowdowns, and proactively address issues before they impact users.

### **Steps:**
1. **Monitor Key Metrics:**
   - Database/query response times, error rates, connection pool stats, index usage, storage I/O, memory/CPU
   - Coverage for all layers: app, DB, infra/network, API
2. **Tools & Practices:**
   - Set up alerting for latency, throughput, resource utilization, query failures
   - Integrate with APM/Infra tools (Datadog, NewRelic, Prometheus, custom)
   - Record baselines and track deltas after deployments or changes
3. **Tune & Improve:**
   - Analyze slow queries, poor indexes, excessive locking, or N+1 issues and adjust config/code
   - Follow up bottleneck root causes to infra (resource limits) or design
4. **Artifacts:**
   - Health dashboards and historical metric charts
   - Periodic performance review slides or reports
---

## Phase 6: Security & Access Controls
### **Objective:**
Ensure only authorized access, enforce privilege separation, and comply with data policies (e.g., PII, GDPR, SOX).

### **Steps:**
1. **Inventory All Users/Roles:**
   - Extract actual users/services from database and config/service accounts
   - Compare against documented policy (least privilege)
2. **AuthN/AuthZ Review:**
   - Audit access logs, review password/key rotation, MFA, RBAC/ABAC use in DBMS and apps
   - Validate expiry, offboarding, and revocation procedures
3. **Data Security:**
   - Check data-at-rest and data-in-transit encryption
   - Review audit logging, masking, retention, and deletion policies
4. **Artifacts:**
   - Security audit log summary
   - List of review findings & remediation tickets
---

## Phase 7: Change & Incident Management
### **Objective:**
Audit and improve how database and data changes are planned, tested, documented, and rolled back, increasing change resiliency.

### **Steps:**
1. **Change Tracking:**
   - Ensure all major data/schema/config changes are in VCS or change logs
   - Maintain or implement ADRs (see templates) for each significant design/architectural or dependency decision
2. **Review Procedures:**
   - Use peer review, testing in non-prod, blue/green or canary deployments for riskier changes
   - Implement and monitor incident response and rollback playbooks
3. **Document Outcomes:**
   - Record incident reports, postmortems, and lessons-learned
4. **Artifacts:**
   - Change approval records (tickets)
   - Rollback and incident response runbook
   - Living ADR log
---

## Phase 8: Continuous Improvement & Reporting
### **Objective:**
Iteratively refine practices, close gaps, and communicate findings to drive long-term data reliability and value.

### **Steps:**
1. **Regular Review Cycles:**
   - Run periodic (monthly/quarterly/after big changes) audits using prior phases as checklist
   - Debrief with stakeholders for feedback on improvement plan and open issues
2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Continuously update architecture, inventory, and dependency artifacts
   - Retire deprecated elements and identify new best practices
3. **Reporting:**
   - Generate audit and improvement reports with current state, risks, and action items
   - Track all findings, with status and timelines, in a central, versioned location
---

## Best Practices
- Maintain every artifact as ‘living’—versioned and routinely updated
- Automate as much data collection and validation as possible
- Integrate audits with CI/CD and deployment workflows
- Cross-train teams to avoid single points of failure
- Enforce communication and visibility of all audit, incident, and change data
- Use standard frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001/2, NIST, CIS, CMMI) where needed for better alignment and compliance
