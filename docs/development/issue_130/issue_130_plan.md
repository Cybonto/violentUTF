# Issue #130 Implementation Plan: JudgeBench Meta-Evaluation Converter

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for GitHub Issue #130, which involves creating a sophisticated converter to transform JudgeBench meta-evaluation datasets into PyRIT SeedPromptDataset format. The implementation follows Strategy 4 (meta-evaluation framework) to enable comprehensive AI judge assessment and comparison capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The ViolentUTF platform needs the ability to process JudgeBench datasets for meta-evaluation of AI judges - essentially creating "judge-the-judge" capabilities. This requires:

1. **Judge Output File Processing**: Parse multiple JSONL files containing judge evaluations
2. **Meta-Evaluation Prompt Generation**: Create prompts that evaluate judge performance
3. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze judge consistency, reasoning quality, and bias patterns
4. **Dataset Conversion**: Transform to PyRIT-compatible SeedPromptDataset format

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. JudgeBenchConverter (Main Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Main conversion orchestrator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Discover and process judge output files
  - Coordinate conversion workflow
  - Generate final SeedPromptDataset
  - Handle error recovery and validation

#### 2. MetaEvaluationPromptGenerator
- **Purpose**: Generate meta-evaluation prompts for judge assessment
- **Key Features**:
  - Template-based prompt construction
  - Judge-specific evaluation criteria
  - Configurable scoring dimensions
  - Context-aware prompt generation

#### 3. JudgePerformanceAnalyzer
- **Purpose**: Analyze judge performance indicators
- **Analysis Areas**:
  - Reasoning quality assessment
  - Score appropriateness evaluation
  - Consistency indicators
  - Bias detection patterns

#### 4. Supporting Data Classes
- **SeedPrompt**: PyRIT-compatible prompt container
- **SeedPromptDataset**: Complete dataset wrapper
- **JudgeFileInfo**: Judge metadata container
- **JudgeAnalysis**: Performance analysis results

### File Processing Workflow

```
1. Discover Judge Files
   ├── Pattern: dataset=judgebench,response_model=X,judge_name=Y,judge_model=Z.jsonl
   └── Multiple files per judge configuration

2. Parse File Metadata
   ├── Extract judge name, model, response model
   └── Validate filename format

3. Process Evaluations
   ├── Stream JSONL content
   ├── Handle JSON parsing errors
   └── Create meta-evaluation prompts

4. Generate Dataset
   ├── Aggregate all prompts
   ├── Create comprehensive metadata
   └── Return SeedPromptDataset
```

### Meta-Evaluation Strategy

The converter implements a comprehensive judge assessment framework:

#### Base Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: How well did the judge evaluate response quality?
- **Consistency**: Is the score consistent with reasoning provided?
- **Completeness**: Did the judge address all relevant criteria?
- **Reasoning Quality**: How clear and logical is the judge's reasoning?
- **Bias Detection**: Are there signs of systematic bias?
- **Score Appropriateness**: Is the numerical score appropriate?

#### Judge-Specific Dimensions
Different judge types have additional evaluation criteria:
- **LLM Judges**: Model alignment, prompt sensitivity
- **Human Judges**: Inter-rater reliability, domain expertise
- **Preference Judges**: Preference consistency, ranking logic

## Implementation Details

### File Format Support

The converter processes judge output files with this naming convention:
```
dataset=judgebench,response_model={MODEL},judge_name={JUDGE},judge_model={MODEL}.jsonl
```

Each JSONL line contains:
```json
{
  "judge_response": "Judge's evaluation text",
  "score": 8.5,
  "reasoning": "Judge's reasoning explanation",
  "original_task": "Original task prompt",
  "evaluation_criteria": ["accuracy", "completeness"]
}
```

### Meta-Evaluation Prompt Structure

Generated prompts follow this comprehensive template:

```
=== ORIGINAL TASK ===
{original_task}

=== JUDGE INFORMATION ===
Judge Name: {judge_name}
Judge Model: {judge_model}
Evaluated Response Model: {response_model}

=== JUDGE'S EVALUATION ===
Judge Response: {judge_response}
Judge Score: {judge_score}
Judge Reasoning: {judge_reasoning}

=== META-EVALUATION REQUEST ===
[Detailed assessment criteria and instructions]
```

### Performance Analysis Features
