## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Layout Architecture

#### Option 1: Full-Width Conditional Layout
```python
# Conditional layout based on dataset source
def detect_layout_context() -> str:
    source = st.session_state.get("dataset_source")
    return "fullwidth" if source == "native" else "columns"

# Implementation
if layout_context == "fullwidth":
    render_fullwidth_interface()  # No column constraints
else:
    col1, col2 = st.columns([1, 1])  # Existing 2-column layout
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Minimal disruption to existing workflows
- ‚úÖ Automatic optimization based on content type
- ‚úÖ Preserves muscle memory for existing users
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain and debug

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Still uses 2-column layout for some sources
- ‚ùå Less dramatic improvement for non-native datasets
- ‚ùå Limited space optimization potential

#### Option 2: Tab-Based Architecture
```python
# Complete redesign with top-level tabs
tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["‚öôÔ∏è Configure", "üß™ Test", "üìã Manage"])

with tab1:
    render_configure_tab()     # Full page width
with tab2:
    render_test_tab()          # Full page width
with tab3:
    render_manage_tab()        # Full page width
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum space utilization (100% page width)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Excellent for task-focused workflows
- ‚úÖ Scales well with additional features

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires users to learn new navigation
- ‚ùå More complex implementation
- ‚ùå Potential for feature discovery issues

#### Option 3: Progressive Disclosure
```python
# Adaptive interface based on user experience
if st.session_state.get("progressive_mode") == "simple":
    render_simple_wizard()     # Step-by-step guidance
else:
    render_advanced_mode()     # Full feature access
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Adapts to user skill level automatically
- ‚úÖ Excellent onboarding for new users
- ‚úÖ Full power mode for advanced users
- ‚úÖ Reduces cognitive load effectively

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Most complex implementation
- ‚ùå Requires maintaining two interfaces
- ‚ùå Mode switching can be confusing initially
