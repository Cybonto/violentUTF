# ViolentUTF Scorer Result Inconsistency Investigation - Final Report

## Investigation Period: 2025-01-15

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive investigation was conducted to identify inconsistencies between actual scorer results and their display in the ViolentUTF Dashboard. The investigation followed a systematic 5-phase approach and revealed that **the core data pipeline is functioning correctly**. The perceived inconsistencies stem from display logic issues, filtering problems, and missing context rather than data corruption.

## Key Findings

### 1. ‚úÖ **Data Integrity is Maintained**
- Boolean scores are correctly stored as Python bool types (not strings)
- JSON serialization preserves data types appropriately  
- SQLite storage maintains type fidelity
- 677 boolean scores analyzed: 642 True, 35 False (all proper bool type)

### 2. ‚ùå **Display and Filtering Issues Identified**
- **Timezone Parsing**: Mixed timezone-aware and naive datetimes cause filter failures
- **Aggregation Logic**: Different scorer types mixed inappropriately in statistics
- **Missing Context**: Score rationales and metadata stripped from displays
- **Defensive Gaps**: Code lacks validation for edge cases

### 3. üîç **No Systematic Data Type Transformation Issues**
- Initial hypothesis of boolean-to-string conversion was **disproven**
- Data types remain consistent through PyRIT ‚Üí Orchestrator ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí API pipeline
- The `is True` check in Dashboard works correctly with current data

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Flow Mapping
- Analyzed PyRIT scorer implementations (14 scorer types found)
- Examined orchestrator collection logic (preserves types correctly)
- Reviewed Dashboard query and display code (found logic issues)

### Phase 2: Inspection Tool Development
- Created type inspection utilities
- Built aggregation auditors
- Developed controlled testing framework

### Phase 3: Systematic Testing
- Executed controlled data flow tests
- Verified type preservation at each stage
- Tested edge cases and interpretation logic

### Phase 4: Pattern Documentation
- Identified timezone handling as primary issue
- Confirmed boolean handling works correctly
- Found defensive programming gaps

### Phase 5: Root Cause Analysis
- Determined issues are in presentation layer, not data layer
- Identified specific code locations requiring fixes
- Provided actionable recommendations

## Specific Issues Found

### 1. **Timezone Parsing Failure**
```python
# Problem: Comparing naive and aware datetimes
"2024-07-10T14:46:00"  # Fails to parse
"2024-07-10T14:46:00+00:00"  # Works correctly
```

### 2. **SEVERITY_MAP Defensive Gap**
```python
# Current: Uses truthiness (risky for edge cases)
"true_false": lambda val: "high" if val else "low"

# Should be: Explicit type checking
"true_false": lambda val: "high" if val is True else "low"
```

### 3. **Mixed Aggregations**
- Boolean and scale scores aggregated together
- Different scorer meanings combined in statistics
- Context lost during aggregation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Priority 1)
1. **Fix timezone parsing** - Always use timezone-aware datetime objects
2. **Add type validation** - Check score_value types before processing
3. **Separate aggregations** - Group statistics by scorer type
4. **Show score context** - Display rationale and metadata

### Code Changes Required

#### 5_Dashboard.py - Timezone Fix
```python
# Add timezone awareness to datetime parsing
if '+' not in time_str and 'Z' not in time_str:
    parsed = datetime.fromisoformat(time_str).replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
else:
    parsed = datetime.fromisoformat(time_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
```

#### 5_Dashboard.py - Type Validation
```python
# Add before processing scores
def validate_score_value(score):
    score_type = score.get('score_type')
    value = score.get('score_value')
    
    if score_type == 'true_false' and not isinstance(value, bool):
        logger.warning(f"Unexpected type for boolean score: {type(value)}")
        # Convert if needed
        if value in ['True', 'true', 1, '1']:
            return True
        elif value in ['False', 'false', 0, '0']:
            return False
    return value
```

### Medium-term Improvements
1. Implement comprehensive logging at transformation points
2. Create data quality monitoring dashboard
3. Add automated tests for edge cases
4. Document score interpretation guidelines

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Enforce schema validation at API boundaries
2. Standardize datetime handling across platform
3. Implement real-time data quality alerts
4. Create user guide for score interpretations

## Conclusion

The investigation successfully identified that the perceived inconsistencies are not due to data corruption or type transformation issues, but rather stem from:

1. **Timezone handling problems** causing data to be filtered out
2. **Aggregation logic** that mixes different scorer types
3. **Missing context** in score displays
4. **Lack of defensive programming** for edge cases

The core data pipeline is robust and maintains data integrity. The recommended fixes focus on improving the presentation layer and adding defensive measures to handle edge cases gracefully.
