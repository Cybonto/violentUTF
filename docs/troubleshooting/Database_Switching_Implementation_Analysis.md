# Database Switching Fix - Implementation Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the complexity, feasibility, and strategic approach for fixing the database switching issue in ViolentUTF's Enterprise environment. The recommendations balance immediate stability needs with long-term architectural improvements.

## Immediate Fixes Analysis

### 1. Use Consistent Database Path

**Implementation Complexity**: ⭐⭐ (Low-Medium)

**Pros:**
- Simple code change - mainly string formatting
- Addresses root cause directly
- Low risk of introducing new bugs
- Can be implemented in 1-2 hours
- Backward compatible with existing data

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix underlying architectural issues
- Still vulnerable to memory management problems
- May need migration logic for existing orphaned database files

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Current problematic code (creates new file each time)
api_memory_file = os.path.join(api_memory_dir, f"orchestrator_memory_{orchestrator_id[:8]}.db")

# Fixed code (uses consistent user-specific path)
def get_user_memory_path(user_id: str) -> str:
    salt = os.getenv("PYRIT_DB_SALT", "default_salt_2025")
    user_hash = hashlib.sha256((salt + user_id).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
    return os.path.join("/app/app_data/violentutf", f"pyrit_memory_{user_hash}.db")
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/pyrit_orchestrator_service.py` (2 locations)
- `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/dataset_integration_service.py` (1 location)

### 2. Database Connection Pooling

**Implementation Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Pros:**
- Prevents database lock conflicts
- Improves performance through connection reuse
- Reduces resource consumption
- Provides better error handling

**Cons:**
- Requires understanding of DuckDB concurrency model
- Need to handle connection lifecycle properly
- Potential for connection leaks if not implemented carefully
- Testing complexity increases

**Implementation Details:**
```python
class DatabaseConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._connections: Dict[str, DuckDBMemory] = {}
        self._locks: Dict[str, asyncio.Lock] = {}

    async def get_connection(self, db_path: str):
        # Ensure single connection per database file
        # Handle connection cleanup and error recovery
```

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- New: `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/db_connection_manager.py`
- Modify: `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/pyrit_memory_bridge.py`
- Modify: `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/pyrit_orchestrator_service.py`

### 3. Basic Orchestrator Instance Pooling

**Implementation Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Medium-High)

**Pros:**
- Prevents frequent orchestrator recreation
- Reduces memory allocation overhead
- Improves response times
- Addresses core issue of instance lifecycle

**Cons:**
- Complex orchestrator lifecycle management
- Need to handle orchestrator expiration and cleanup
- Potential memory leaks if not managed properly
- Configuration drift between pool instances

**Implementation Details:**
```python
class OrchestratorPool:
    def __init__(self, max_instances: int = 10, ttl_minutes: int = 30):
        self._pool: Dict[str, Dict] = {}
        self._max_instances = max_instances

    def get_or_create(self, config: Dict) -> Orchestrator:
        # Handle LRU eviction, expiration, cleanup
```

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- New: `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/orchestrator_pool.py`
- Modify: `violentutf_api/fastapi_app/app/services/pyrit_orchestrator_service.py`

- Provides clean slate for users
- Enables database consolidation
- Supports data integrity verification

**Cons:**
- Risk of data corruption during migration
- Complex conflict resolution (duplicate data)
- Requires downtime for migration
- May lose some historical data if files are corrupted

**Implementation Considerations:**
```python
class DatabaseMigrationService:
    def migrate_user_data(self, user_id: str):
        # Find all database files for user
        # Consolidate data into single file
        # Handle conflicts and duplicates
        # Verify data integrity
```

### 3. Health Monitoring

**Implementation Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Pros:**
- Early detection of database switching
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Better debugging and troubleshooting
- Supports proactive maintenance

**Cons:**
- Additional infrastructure overhead

    salt = os.getenv("PYRIT_DB_SALT", "default_salt_2025")
    user_hash = hashlib.sha256((salt + user_id).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
    return os.path.join("/app/app_data/violentutf", f"pyrit_memory_{user_hash}.db")

# Step 2: Add basic connection management
class SimpleConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._connections = {}
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
```
