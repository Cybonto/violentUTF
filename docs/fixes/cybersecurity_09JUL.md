**Current Docker Images (13 Total)**:
```
REPOSITORY                  TAG              SIZE      RISK LEVEL
gsai-container              latest           609MB     ⚠️ MEDIUM
apisix-fastapi              latest           5.58GB    🔴 HIGH
grafana/grafana             latest           847MB     🟡 LOW-MEDIUM
postgres                    15               628MB     ✅ LOW
prom/prometheus             latest           411MB     🟡 LOW-MEDIUM
apache/apisix               latest           529MB     ✅ LOW
quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   26.1.4           693MB     ✅ LOW
apache/apisix-dashboard     latest           549MB     ✅ LOW
```

**Container Security Analysis**:
- ✅ Using official images from reputable sources (Apache, PostgreSQL, Keycloak)
- ✅ PostgreSQL 15 is current LTS version
- ✅ Keycloak 26.1.4 is recent stable version
- 🔴 **Critical**: apisix-fastapi:latest (5.58GB) - Custom image needs security review
- ⚠️ **Medium Risk**: Multiple images using 'latest' tag (not reproducible builds)
- ⚠️ **Large Attack Surface**: apisix-fastapi image is unusually large (5.58GB)

**Container Configuration Security**:
- Multiple Dockerfile configurations found across services
- Docker Compose configurations with service isolation
- Network segmentation through `vutf-network`

### 4. Configuration Security Analysis

**Secret Management Analysis**:
- ✅ Proper use of `.env.sample` files with placeholder values  
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found in configuration files
- ✅ Environment variable-based configuration
- ✅ AI tokens properly templated in sample files
- ⚠️ Multiple `.env` files with potential credential exposure

**Environment Files Identified** (10 files):
```
./ai-tokens.env.sample          ✅ Template
./ai-tokens.env                 ⚠️ Contains actual tokens  
./apisix/.env                   ⚠️ Service credentials
./violentutf_api/fastapi_app/.env ⚠️ API credentials
./violentutf/.env               ⚠️ App credentials
./keycloak/.env                 ⚠️ SSO credentials
```

**HMAC/Authentication Security**:
- Gateway authentication using HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Shared secret management between APISIX and FastAPI
- Timestamp-based signature validation
- Proper signature generation and verification logic

### 5. CI/CD Security Pipeline Analysis

**Current Security Integration** (from .github/workflows/full-ci.yml):

**✅ Implemented Security Tools**:
- **Semgrep**: Multi-ruleset static analysis (security-audit, python, django, flask, jwt)
- **Bandit**: Comprehensive Python security scanning with SARIF upload
- **pip-audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning with JSON output
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Java/dependency scanning
- **Trivy**: Container image security scanning with SARIF integration
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8 formatting and linting

**⚠️ Security Pipeline Gaps**:
- Security scans only run on full CI (main branch, tags, manual dispatch)
- No security gates on development branches (dev_*) 
- Missing security policy enforcement
- No automated security reporting/notifications
- Limited security metrics collection

## Remediation Plan

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Critical - Fix Today)

1. **Upgrade Critical Dependencies** (CRITICAL):
```bash
# High-risk vulnerabilities
pip install "requests>=2.32.4"           # Credential leakage fix
pip install "pillow>=11.3.0"             # Buffer overflow fix
pip install "mcp>=1.10.0"                # Server crash fix
pip install "transformers>=4.52.1"       # URL injection fix
```

2. **Container Security Audit**:
```bash
# Analyze the large custom image
docker history apisix-fastapi:latest
docker dive apisix-fastapi:latest        # Layer-by-layer analysis
```

3. **Environment File Security**:
```bash
# Audit all .env files for credential exposure
chmod 600 */.env */.*env                 # Restrict permissions
# Review and rotate any exposed credentials
```

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (This Week)

1. **Upgrade Remaining Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install "tornado>=6.5.0"
pip install "protobuf>=6.31.1" 
pip install "urllib3>=2.5.0"
pip install "torch>=2.7.1rc1"            # When available
```

2. **Code Security Fixes**:
```python
# Fix SQL injection in database modules
# Use parameterized queries instead of string formatting
conn.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ?', (table_name,))

# Add request timeouts to prevent DoS
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, timeout=30)

# Secure network bindings
host = os.getenv("API_HOST", "127.0.0.1")  # Instead of 0.0.0.0
```

3. **Container Hardening**:
```yaml
# Pin specific versions in docker-compose.yml
services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:10.2.0         # Instead of :latest
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.47.0        # Instead of :latest
```

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Sprint)

1. **Enhanced CI/CD Security**:
```yaml
# Add security checks to quick-checks.yml for dev branches
- name: Critical Security Scan
  run: |
    bandit -r . -ll --exit-zero           # High severity only
    safety scan --json | jq '.vulnerabilities | length'
```

2. **Security Monitoring**:
```bash
# Add security metrics collection
# Implement automated vulnerability reporting
# Set up security alerting for new vulnerabilities
```

3. **Container Optimization**:
```dockerfile
# Reduce apisix-fastapi image size

4. 🔴 Implement security scanning on development branches

**Strategic Recommendations**:
1. 📊 Enhance CI/CD security pipeline with comprehensive scanning
2. 🛡️ Implement runtime security monitoring
3. 📋 Establish security metrics and SLA management
4. 🔄 Create automated security incident response procedures

The platform's enterprise-grade architecture provides a solid foundation for security improvements. Focus on dependency management, container optimization, and enhanced security automation will significantly improve the overall security posture.
