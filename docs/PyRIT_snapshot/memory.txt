# Memory

PyRIT's memory component allows users to track and manage a history of interactions throughout an attack scenario. This feature enables the storage, retrieval, and sharing of conversation entries, making it easier to maintain context and continuity in ongoing interactions.

To simplify memory interaction, the `pyrit.memory.CentralMemory` class automatically manages a shared memory instance across all components in a session. Memory must be set explicitly.

**Manual Memory Setting**:

At the beginning of each notebook, make sure to call:
```
# Import initialize_pyrit
# Import the specific constant for the MemoryDatabaseType, or provide the literal value
from pyrit.common import initialize_pyrit, IN_MEMORY, DUCK_DB, AZURE_SQL

initialize_pyrit(memory_db_type: MemoryDatabaseType, memory_instance_kwargs: Optional[Any])
```

The `MemoryDatabaseType` is a `Literal` with 3 options: IN_MEMORY, DUCK_DB, AZURE_SQL. (Read more below)
   - `initialize_pyrit` takes the `MemoryDatabaseType` and an argument list (`memory_instance_kwargs`), to initialize the shared memory instance.

##  Memory Database Type Options

**IN_MEMORY:** _In-Memory DuckDB Database_
   - This option can be preferable if the user does not care about storing conversations or scores in memory beyond the current process. It is used as the default in most of the PyRIT notebooks.
   - **Note**: In in-memory mode, no data is persisted to disk, therefore, all data is lost when the process finishes (from [DuckDB docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/connect/overview.html#in-memory-database))

**DUCK_DB:** _Persistent DuckDB Database_
   - Interactions will be stored in a persistent `DuckDBMemory` instance with a location on-disk. See notebook [here](./1_duck_db_memory.ipynb) for more details.

**AZURE_SQL:** _Azure SQL Database_
   - For examples on setting up `AzureSQLMemory`, please refer to the notebook [here](./7_azure_sql_memory_orchestrators.ipynb).
   - To configure AzureSQLMemory without an extra argument list, these keys should be in your `.env` file:
     - `AZURE_SQL_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`
     - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_DB_DATA_CONTAINER_URL`

# 2. Basic Memory Programming Usage

The `pyrit.memory` module provides functionality to keep track of the conversation history, scoring, data, and more. You can use memory to read and write data. Here is an example that retrieves a normalized conversation:
"""

from uuid import uuid4

from pyrit.memory.duckdb_memory import DuckDBMemory
from pyrit.models import PromptRequestPiece, PromptRequestResponse

conversation_id = str(uuid4())

message_list = [
    PromptRequestPiece(
        role="user", original_value="Hi, chat bot! This is my initial prompt.", conversation_id=conversation_id
    ),
    PromptRequestPiece(

        role="user",

    ),
]

memory = DuckDBMemory()

# 3. PromptRequestPiece and PromptRequestResposne

One of the most basic data structures is [PromptRequestPiece](../../../pyrit/models/prompt_request_piece.py) and [PromptRequestResponse](../../../pyrit/models/prompt_request_response.py).

`PromptRequestPiece` is a single piece of a request to a target. It has a `role` (e.g. user), a `type` (like text or image_path), a `value` (like "hello, how are you"), and various other fields. This is a unit that is stored in the database.

`PromptRequestResponse` can be thought of as a single request or response to a target. It can contain multiple `PromptRequestPieces`. E.g. if you send an image with text in a single request, one `PromptRequestResponse` is made up of two `PromptRequestPieces`.

This is plumbed all the way through PyRIT, and the flexibility allows us to interact with various modalities seemlessly.

File: doc/code/memory/4_manually_working_with_memory.md
================================================
# 4. Working with Memory Manually

After or during an operation or a test, it can be important to use the memory in the database in a straightforward way.

There are many ways to do this, but this section gives some general ideas on how users can solve common problems.

## Sharing Data Between Users

There are two ways to share prompt and score data between users. The first is to use a central database shared among users hosted on an Azure SQL Server! See [here](../memory/6_azure_sql_memory.ipynb) for instructions on set up.

The second way to share data is to use local DuckDB Memory (see [here](../memory/1_duck_db_memory.ipynb)) and do the following:

1. Export and import the database as described [here](https://dbeaver.com/docs/dbeaver/Data-transfer/). This allows a lot of flexibility and can include partial exports (for example based on labels or time):
2. Copy the PyRIT `results/dbdata` directory over; it will contain multi-modal data that the database references.

See https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver.html for a more comprehensive guide on using DBeaver.

## Using DuckDB and Excel to Query and Visualize Data

This is especially nice with scoring. There are countless ways to do this, but this shows one example;

1. Run a query with the data you want. This is an example where we're only querying scores with the "float_scale" `score_type` in the category of "misinformation."

![scoring_1.png](../../../assets/scoring_1.png)

2. Export the data to a CSV.

![scoring_2.png](../../../assets/scoring_2_export.png)

3. Use it as an excel sheet! You can use pivot tables, etc. to visualize the data.

![scoring_2.png](../../../assets/scoring_3_pivot.png)

## Using AzureSQL Query Editor to Query and Export Data
If you are using an AzureSQL Database, you can use the Query Editor to run SQL queries to retrieve desired data. Memory labels (`labels`) may be an especially useful column to query on for finding data pertaining to a specific operation, user, harm_category, etc. Memory labels are a free-from dictionary for tagging prompts with whatever information you'd like (e.g. `op_name`, `username`, `harm_category`). (For more information on memory labels, see the [Memory Labels Guide](../memory/5_memory_labels.ipynb).) An example is shown below:

1. Write a SQL query in the Query Editor. You can either write these manually or use the "Open Query" option to load one in. The image below shows a query that gathers prompt entries with their corresponding scores for a specific operation (using the `labels` column) with a "float_scale" `score_type`.

![azuresqlquery_1.png](../../../assets/azuresqlquery_1.png)

2. You can then export the results of your query as .json, .csv, or .xml based on your needs. You can additionally use the "Save query" feature to save the query for future use.

![azuresqlquery_2.png](../../../assets/azuresqlquery_2_export.png)

3. Now that you have your data in a format of your choice, feel free to analyze, interpret, and visualize it in whatever way you desire!

## Updating DB Entries Manually
If you catch entries you want to update (e.g., if you want to correct scores or change labels of a prompt), you could either change them in the database or in Excel and re-import. (Note: the most stable way of doing this is in the database since the mapping can be off in some cases when reimporting.) Entries in the database can be updated using a PyRIT function located in `memory_interface.py` such as `update_entries` or `update_labels_by_conversation_id` (work for both AzureSQLMemory and DuckDBMemory). Alternatively, a data management tool like DBeaver can be used to directly update locally stored memory entries in DuckDB.

## Entering Manual Prompts

Although most prompts are run through `PromptTargets` which will add prompts to memory, there are a few reasons you may want to enter in manual prompts. For example, if you ssh into a box, are not using PyRIT to probe for weaknesses, but want to add prompts later for reporting or scoring.

One of the easiest way to add prompts is through the `TextTarget` target. You can create a csv of prompts that looks as follows:

```
role, value
user, hello
assistant, hi how are you?
user, new conversation
```

This very simple format doesn't have very much information, but already it standardizes the prompts that can then be used in mass scoring (or manual scoring with HITLScorer).

And you can import it using code like this

```
target = TextTarget()
target.import_scores_from_csv(csv_file_path=".\path.csv")
```

"""
# 5. Resending Prompts Using Memory Labels Example

Memory labels are a free-from dictionary for tagging prompts for easier querying and scoring later on. The `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS`
environment variable can be set to apply labels (e.g. `username` and `op_name`) to all prompts sent by any orchestrator. You can also
pass additional memory labels to `send_prompts_async` in the `PromptSendingOrchestrator` or `run_attack_async` for all `MultiTurnOrchestrators`.
Passed-in labels will be combined with `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS` into one dictionary. In the case of collisions,
the passed-in labels take precedence.

You can then query the database (either AzureSQL or DuckDB) for prompts with specific labels, such as `username` and/or `op_name`
(which are standard), as well as any others you'd like, including `harm_category`, `language`, `technique`, etc.

We take the following steps in this example:
1. Send prompts to a text target using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, passing in `memory_labels` to `send_prompts_async`.
2. Retrieve these prompts by querying for the corresponding memory label(s).
3. Resend the retrieved prompts.

Note that similar steps can be taken with `MultiTurnOrchestrators` as well by passing in `memory_labels` to `run_attack_async`.

The main format PyRIT works with is the `PromptRequestPiece` paradigm. Any time a user wants to store or retrieve a chat message, they will use the `PromptRequestPiece` object. However, `ChatMessage` is very common, so there are a lot of times this is the most useful. Any `PromptRequestPiece` object can be translated into a `ChatMessage` object.

However, different models may require different formats. For example, certain models may use chatml, or may not support system messages. This is handled
in from `ChatMessageNormalizer` and its subclasses.

Below is an example that converts a list of chat messages to chatml format and back.
