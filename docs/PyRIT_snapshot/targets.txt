# Prompt Targets

Prompt Targets are endpoints for where to send prompts. For example, a target could be a GPT-4 or Llama endpoint. Targets are typically used with other components like [orchestrators](../orchestrators/0_orchestrator.md), [scorers](../scoring/0_scoring.md), and [converters](../converters/0_converters.ipynb).

- An orchestrator's main job is to change prompts to a given format, apply any converters, and then send them off to prompt targets (sometimes using various strategies). Within an orchestrator, prompt targets are (mostly) swappable, meaning you can use the same logic with different target endpoints.
- A scorer's main job is to score a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given scorer can often use different configured targets.
- A converter's job is to transform a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given converter can use different configured targets.

Prompt targets are found [here](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/main/pyrit/prompt_target/) in code.


## Send_Prompt_Async

The main entry method follow the following signature:

```
async def send_prompt_async(self, *, prompt_request: PromptRequestResponse) -> PromptRequestResponse:
```

A `PromptRequestResponse` object is a normalized object with all the information a target will need to send a prompt, including a way to get a history for that prompt (in the cases that also needs to be sent). This is discussed in more depth [here](../memory/3_prompt_request.md).

## PromptChatTargets vs PromptTargets

A `PromptTarget` is a generic place to send a prompt. With PyRIT, the idea is that it will eventually be consumed by an AI application, but that doesn't have to be immediate. For example, you could have a SharePoint target. Everything you send a prompt to is a `PromptTarget`. Many attacks work generically with any `PromptTarget` including `RedTeamingOrchestrator` and `PromptSendingOrchestrator`.

With some algorithms, you want to send a prompt, set a system prompt, and modify conversation history (including PAIR, TAP, flip attack). These often require a `PromptChatTarget`, which implies you can modify a conversation history. `PromptChatTarget` is a subclass of `PromptTarget`.

Here are some examples:

| Example                             | Is `PromptChatTarget`?               | Notes                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenAIChatTarget** (e.g., GPT-4)  | **Yes** (`PromptChatTarget`)         | Designed for conversational prompts (system messages, conversation history, etc.).               |
| **OllamaChatTarget** (e.g., Llama3) | **Yes** (`PromptChatTarget`)         | Also handles conversation history similarly to OpenAIChatTarget.                                 |
| **OpenAIDALLETarget**               | **No** (not a `PromptChatTarget`)    | Used for image generation; does not manage conversation history.                                 |
| **HTTPTarget**                      | **No** (not a `PromptChatTarget`)    | Generic HTTP target. Some apps might allow conversation history, but this target doesn't handle it. |
| **AzureBlobStorageTarget**          | **No** (not a `PromptChatTarget`)    | Used primarily for storage; not for conversation-based AI.                                       |

# 1. OpenAI Chat Target

In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.

For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `PromptRequestResponse` objects, it is almost always better to use an orchestrator. The simplest orchestrator is the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.

Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

## OpenAI Configuration

All `OpenAITarget`s can communicate either to [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction). By default, it uses Azure OpenAI (we are Microsoft funded after all!) but you can configure a target to use OpenAI by passing the `is_azure_target=False` flag.

Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint`, `deployment_name`, and `api_key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).

- api_key: By default, these targets will use an API key configured within environment variables (or .env) to authenticate (`OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for OpenAI and `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for AOAI).
- endpoint: AOAI needs an endpoint URI from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are just "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" and do not need to be configured by the user.
- deployment_name: Azure Open AI needs this from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

For AOAI, There is an option to use the DefaultAzureCredential for User Authentication as well, for all AOAI Chat Targets. When `use_aad_auth=True`, ensure the user has 'Cognitive Service OpenAI User' role assigned on the AOAI Resource and `az login` is used to authenticate with the correct identity.

# 2. Creating Custom Targets

Often, to use PyRIT, you need to create custom targets so it can interact with the system you're testing. [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) and [Crucible](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/) are both platforms designed as playgrounds that emulate AI applications. This demo shows how to use PyRIT to connect with these endpoints. If you're testing your own custom endpoint, a good start is often to build a target, and then you will be able to interact with it similar to this demo.

Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

## Gandalf Target

Gandalf is similar to a real-world application you might be using PyRIT to test. The code for PyRIT's Gandalf target can be found [here](../../../pyrit/prompt_target/gandalf_target.py) and is similar to the code you would use to connect PyRIT to a real-world custom endpoint.

> Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.
> However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?
> (There is a bonus level 8)
> https://gandalf.lakera.ai/


Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo, we will show how to automatically bypass (at least) the first couple. It uses the [RedTeamingOrchestrator](../orchestrators/2_multi_turn_orchestrators.ipynb) as a strategy to solve these challenges.

Each level gets progressively more difficult. Before continuing, it may be beneficial to manually try the Gandalf challenges to get a feel for how they are solved.

In this demo below we also use a standard `AzureOpenAI` target as an "AI Red Team Bot". This is attacker infrastructure, and is used to help the attacker generate prompts to bypass Gandalf protections.

<img src="../../../assets/gandalf-demo-setup.png" alt="gandalf-demo-setup.png" height="400"/>

**Step 1.** AI Red Team Orchestrator sends a message to Gandalf. <br>
**Step 2.** Gandalf sends a message back. <br>
**Step 3.** The reply is passed to PyRIT's scoring engine to determine if the password was revealed. <br>
**Step 4.** The scoring engine sends the potential password from the response to Gandalf. <br>
**Step 5.** Gandalf responds with success or failure. <br>
**Step 6.** If the password was leaked in the response, the conversation is completed. Otherwise, the Red Team Orchestrator continues from Step 1 with the knowledge of the previous iteration. <br>

# 3. AML Chat Targets

This code shows how to use Azure Machine Learning (AML) managed online endpoints with PyRIT.

## Prerequisites

1. **Deploy an AML-Managed Online Endpoint:** Confirm that an Azure Machine Learning managed online endpoint is
     already deployed.

1. **Obtain the API Key:**
   - Navigate to the AML Studio.
   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.
   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI from the 'Consume' tab
   <br> <img src="../../../assets/aml_managed_online_endpoint_api_key.png" alt="aml_managed_online_endpoint_api_key.png" height="400"/> <br>

1. **Set the Environment Variable:**
   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_KEY`. This is the default API key when the target is instantiated.
   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`. This is the default endpoint URI when the target is instantiated.
   - If you'd like, feel free to make additional API key and endpoint URI environment variables in your .env file for different deployed models (e.g. mistralai-Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v01,
     Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, etc.)
     and pass them in as arguments to the `_set_env_configuration_vars` function to interact with those models.


## Create a AzureMLChatTarget

After deploying a model and populating your env file, send prompts to the model using the `AzureMLChatTarget` class. Model parameters can be passed upon instantiation
or set using the _set_model_parameters() function. `**param_kwargs` allows for the setting of other parameters not explicitly shown in the constructor. A general list of
possible adjustable parameters can be found here: https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/tasks/text-generation but note that not all parameters may have an effect
depending on the specific model. The parameters that can be set per model can usually be found in the 'Consume' tab when you navigate to your endpoint in AML Studio.

You can then use this cell anywhere you would use a `PromptTarget` object.
For example, you can create a red teaming orchestrator and use this instead of the `AzureOpenAI` target and do the [Gandalf or Crucible Demos](./2_custom_targets.ipynb) but use this AML model.

This is also shown in the [Red Teaming Orchestrator](../orchestrators/2_multi_turn_orchestrators.ipynb) documentation.

# 4. Azure Blob Storage Targets

Prompt Targets are most often LLMs, but not always. They should be thought of as anything that you send prompts to.


The `AzureBlobStorageTarget` inherits from `PromptTarget`, meaning it has functionality to send prompts. In contrast to `PromptChatTarget`s, `PromptTarget`s do not interact with chat assistants.
This prompt target in particular will take in a prompt and upload it as a text file to the provided Azure Storage Account Container.
This could be useful for Cross-Prompt Injection Attack scenarios, for example, where there is a jailbreak within a file.

# GroqChatTarget

This example demonstrates how to use the `GroqChatTarget` class in PyRIT to send a prompt
to a Groq model and retrieve a response.

## Setup
Before running this example, you need to set the following environment variables:

```
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export GROQ_MODEL_NAME="llama3-8b-8192"
```

Alternatively, you can pass these values as arguments when initializing `GroqChatTarget`:

```python
groq_target = GroqChatTarget(model_name="llama3-8b-8192", api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

You can also limit the request rate using `max_requests_per_minute`.

## Example
The following code initializes `GroqChatTarget`, sends a prompt using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`,
and retrieves a response.

# Playwright Target:

This notebook demonstrates how to interact with the **Playwright Target** in PyRIT.

The `PlaywrightTarget` class allows you to interact with web applications using
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).
This is useful for testing interactions with web applications, such as chatbots or other web interfaces,
especially for red teaming purposes.

## Example Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and any necessary secrets configured as
described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

To run the Flask app, you also must download and run Ollama, making sure the flask is using a correct model.

Additionally, you need to install playwright by executing `playwright install`.

We'll define an interaction function that navigates to the web application, inputs a prompt, and retrieves the
bot's response.

"""
This is a brief tutorial and documentation on using the Prompt Shield Target
"""

"""
Below is a very quick summary of how Prompt Shield works. You can visit the following links to learn more:\
(Docs): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection\
(Quickstart Guide): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-jailbreak

You will need to deploy a content safety endpoint on Azure to use this if you haven't already.

For PyRIT, you can use Prompt Shield as a target, or you can use it as a true/false scorer to see if it detected a jailbreak in your prompt.
"""

"""
## How It Works in More Detail
"""

"""
Prompt Shield is a Content Safety resource that detects attacks (jailbreaks) in the prompts it is given.

The body of the HTTP request you send to it looks like this:
```json
{
    {"userPrompt"}: "this-is-a-user-prompt-as-a-string",
    {"documents"}: [
        "here-is-one-document-as-a-string",
        "here-is-another"
    ]
}
```

And it returns the following in its response:
```json
{
    {"userPromptAnalysis"}: {"attackDetected": "true or false"},
    {"documentsAnalysis"}: [
        {"attackDetected": "true or false for the first document"},
        {"attackDetected": "true or false for the second document"}
    ]
}
```

This document has an example below.

Some caveats and tips:
* You can send any string you like to either of those two fields, but they have to be strings. Note that this includes the documents. For example, a pdf attachment which is a 'document' may be encoded in base64. You can send a string of the encoded pdf if you like, but you may have to decode it or parse it to achieve your goal in the operation (whatever it may be).
* Prompt Shield does have a limit to how many characters you can send in one field (as in, one userPrompt or one document). Be careful when sending ASCII art-encoded prompts, because these will often exceed it.
* The keys for the response are not 'userPrompt' and 'documents', they're 'userPromptAnalysis' and 'documentsAnalysis' as described above. The responses per entry are wrapped with 'attackDetected'. Keep this in mind because it helps diagnose weird bugs with PromptShieldTarget.

The two environment variables you'll need are `AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY`. Make sure to add them to your .env file if you get an error, and that your deployment is in a region where Prompt Shield is supported.

# HuggingFace Chat Target Testing - optional

This notebook is designed to demonstrate **instruction models** that use a **chat template**, allowing users to experiment with structured chat-based interactions.  Non-instruct models are excluded to ensure consistency and reliability in the chat-based interactions. More instruct models can be explored on Hugging Face.

## Key Points:

1. **Supported Instruction Models**:
   - This notebook supports the following **instruct models** that follow a structured chat template. These are examples, and more instruct models are available on Hugging Face:
     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct`
     - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`

     - `...`

2. **Excluded Models**:
   - Non-instruct models (e.g., `"google/gemma-2b"`, `"princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B-ShareGPT"`) are **not included** in this demo, as they do not follow the structured chat template required for the current local Hugging Face model support.

3. **Model Response Times**:
   - The tests were conducted using a CPU, and the following are the average response times for each model:
     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct`: 5.87 seconds
     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct`: 3.09 seconds
     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct`: 3.31 seconds
     - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`: 4.89 seconds
     - `Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct`: 1.38 seconds
     - `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct`: 2.96 seconds
     - `stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b`: 5.31 seconds
     - `stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b`: 8.37 seconds
