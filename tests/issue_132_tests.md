## Success Criteria

### RED Phase Validation
- [ ] All 50+ tests MUST fail initially with expected error messages
- [ ] Each test clearly identifies missing functionality
- [ ] Test failures provide actionable implementation guidance

### GREEN Phase Implementation  
- [ ] Implement minimum code to make each test pass
- [ ] All conversion pipelines functional for 8+ dataset types
- [ ] End-to-end workflows complete from authentication to results
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for all dataset types

### REFACTOR Phase Quality
- [ ] Code coverage >95% across all test categories
- [ ] Performance targets consistently met
- [ ] User acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Regression testing automated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: RED (Failing Tests)
1. Create all test files with failing implementations
2. Validate each test fails with expected error
3. Document missing functionality for each failure

### Phase 2: GREEN (Minimum Implementation)  
1. Implement minimum code to pass each test
2. Focus on functionality over optimization
3. Validate all tests pass consistently

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Quality & Performance)
1. Optimize implementations for performance  
2. Enhance error handling and user experience
3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Validate all quality metrics met

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks

- **Mitigation**: Implement streaming processing and memory monitoring
- **Validation**: Memory usage tests for all dataset sizes

### Scalability Risks  
- **Risk**: Concurrent operations may degrade performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper resource management and queuing
- **Validation**: Load testing with realistic concurrent usage

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: Component integration may introduce instability
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing at each interface
- **Validation**: End-to-end system validation across all components

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Phase 1)
1. Complete integration workflow tests
2. Performance validation framework  
3. System integration testing
4. Basic user scenario testing

### Medium Priority (Phase 2)
1. Load testing and scalability validation
