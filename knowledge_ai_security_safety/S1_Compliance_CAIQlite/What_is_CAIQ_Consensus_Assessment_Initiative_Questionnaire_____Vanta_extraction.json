The CAIQ is structured as a downloadable spreadsheet with questions in a yes-or-no format, allowing vendors to provide explanations for each response. This framework is based on the Cloud Security Alliance's (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix (CCM), which is a detailed guideline of essential security controls for cloud-based services. The methodology involves vendors completing the CAIQ to reflect their security posture, which can then be used by organizations to evaluate the security measures implemented by their cloud service providers.",
