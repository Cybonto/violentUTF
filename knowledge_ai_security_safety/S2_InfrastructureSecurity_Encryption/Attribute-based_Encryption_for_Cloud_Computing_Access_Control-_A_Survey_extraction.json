      "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) for cloud computing access control is reviewed in this article. A taxonomy and comprehensive assessment criteria of ABE are first proposed. In the taxonomy, ABE schemes are assorted into key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) schemes, ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes, anti-quantum ABE schemes, and generic constructions. In accordance with cryptographically functional features, CP-ABE is further divided into nine subcategories with regard to basic functionality, revocation, accountability, policy hiding, policy updating, multi-authority, hierarchy, offline computation, and outsourced computation. In addition, a systematical methodology for discussing and comparing existing ABE schemes is proposed. For KP-ABE and each type of CP-ABE, the corresponding access control scenario is presented and explained by concrete examples. Specifically, the syntax of ABE is given followed by the adversarial model and security goals. ABE schemes are discussed according to the design strategies and special features and are compared in the light of the proposed assessment criteria with respect to security and performance. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, this article not only provides a broader 12 categories of ABE schemes, but also makes a more comprehensive and holistic comparison. Finally, a number of open research challenges in ABE are pointed out.",

The framework includes the development of a taxonomy for ABE schemes, comprehensive assessment criteria, and a systematic methodology for discussing and comparing the schemes. The taxonomy categorizes ABE into key-policy ABE (KP-ABE), ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE), anti-quantum ABE, and generic constructions. CP-ABE is further divided into subcategories based on cryptographically functional features. The assessment criteria are designed to evaluate the security and performance of ABE schemes fairly. The methodology includes presenting application scenarios, defining syntax, adversarial models, security goals, and analyzing design strategies and special features of ABE schemes. The paper also identifies open research challenges in the field of ABE.",
