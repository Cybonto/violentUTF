      "abstract": "The  increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within cybersecurity has necessitated stronger encryption  methods  to  ensure  data  security.  This  paper  presents  a  comparative  analysis  of  symmetric  (SE)  and asymmetric  encryption  (AE)  algorithms,  focusing  on  their  role  in  securing  sensitive  information  in  AI-driven environments.  Through  an  in-depth  study  of  various  encryption  algorithms  such  as  AES,  RSA,  and  others,  this research  evaluates  the  efficiency,  complexity,  and  security  of  these  algorithms  within  modern  cybersecurity frameworks. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analysis, this research explores the historical evolution of encryption algorithms and their growing relevance in AI applications. The comparison of SE and AE algorithms focuses on key factors such as processing speed, scalability, and security resilience in the face of evolving threats. Special attention is given to how these algorithms are integrated into AI systems and how they manage the challenges posed by large-scale data processing in multi-agent environments. Our results highlight that while SE algorithms demonstrate high-speed performance and lower computational demands, AE algorithms provide superior security, particularly in scenarios requiring enhanced encryption for AI-based networks. The paper concludes by addressing the security concerns that encryption algorithms must tackle in the age of AI and outlines future research directions aimed at enhancing encryption techniques for cybersecurity.",
