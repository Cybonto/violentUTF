      "abstract": "As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) grows within the field of cybersecurity, so does the demand for secure and decentralized AI systems to protect against potential cyber threats. Blockchain technology has emerged as the ideal approach for increasing both the security and privacy of AI systems since it provides decentralized and immutable data storage. This systematic literature review focuses on the integration of blockchain technology with decentralized AI within cybersecurity. It provides a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain technology and decentralized AI for cybersecurity, serving as the starting point for the study. This paper begins with an overview of blockchain technology and its possible uses in cybersecurity and also analyzes its challenges and opportunities. Decentralized AI is also covered in the study, along with its potential advantages and difficulties in decentralized AI cybersecurity. Building on that foundation, this study provides convincing findings highlighting the beneficial relationships between blockchain technology and decentralized AI for cybersecurity, contributing to a nuanced comprehension of their integration. Moreover, it offers real-world uses of blockchain-enabled, decentralized AI to discuss its usefulness in tackling cybersecurity concerns. Finally, this paper discusses future research directions for blockchain-enabled decentralized AI in cybersecurity, including potential applications and implications of this technology in the field, emphasizing the potential of blockchain-enabled decentralized AI in cybersecurity to enhance security, privacy, and trust in AI systems.",
