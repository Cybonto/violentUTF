Main features include: 1) The sign and the value of the neural network weights are encrypted with different keys, which shows 2 960  times improvement in key space compared with previous encryption CIM. 2) The multi-bit weights can be in-situ decrypted with the keys within one computing cycle, enabling  the  model  based  on  our  macro  to  achieve  50% improvement  in  measured  energy  efficiency  compared  with encryption CIM. 3) The variability of the MOSFET creates an unclonable  identity  for  each  macro.  Therefore,  the  created macro is still trustworthy even when all the keys are exposed, which is beyond the capability of previous encryption methods.",
