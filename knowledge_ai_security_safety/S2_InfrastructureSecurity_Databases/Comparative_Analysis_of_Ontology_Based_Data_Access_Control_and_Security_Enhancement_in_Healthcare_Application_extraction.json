      "abstract": "Formal, machine-readable theories, taxonomy definitions, and connections to humanreadable language make up ontology, the formal specification of conceptualization. In addition to methodical definitions, it offers axioms that guide the interpretation of words. Many other sorts of relationships, both structural and nonstructural, including inheritance, generalization, aggregation, and instantiation, are supported by an ontology. It is necessary to handle a number of security issues, including identity management, cryptography, trust, application security, authentication, access control, and privacy. Access control is the process of maintaining resource privacy, project-based group membership, and role specificity in accordance with the goals of the ontology under the proposal. This research examines and contrasts three different ontology-based access control strategies: attribute-based access control (ABAC), context-based access control (CBAC), and role-based access control (RBAC). I-RBAC, BRBAC, SA-ODC and RBACSE are the RBAC approaches used for comparison. For analysing the CBAC procedure, ACAIA, CAHMS, CASPSA and FBCAAC algorithms are used. Finally for evaluating the ABAC method, OABAC, FABAC, AWS-IoTAC and ABAC-PHR algorithms are employed. CASPSA, CAHMS, ACAIA and FBCAAC has a data retrieval time of 1.8, 2.4, 6.1, and 9.4 s. IRBAC, BRBAC, SA-ODC and RBACSE has a turn around time of 66.3, 79.1, 150.5, and 177.2 s respectively. According to the experimental results, attribute based access control systems perform better for securing healthcare data.",
