      "abstract": "Access  control  is  a  critical  aspect  of  data  security  in relational database management systems (RDBMS), particularly  in  the  context  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of  techniques and strategies for ensuring AI data access control  in  RDBMS.  The  review  covers  various  aspects including role-based access control, attribute-based access  control,  and  dynamic  access  control  mechanisms tailored for AI-driven  environments.  Additionally,  the paper examines challenges and emerging trends in AI data access control, highlighting the importance of integrating AI technologies to enhance  security and privacy in RDBMS. By synthesizing existing literature and research findings, this paper aims to provide insights and recommendations  for  effectively  implementing  AI  data access control in RDBMS environments.",
