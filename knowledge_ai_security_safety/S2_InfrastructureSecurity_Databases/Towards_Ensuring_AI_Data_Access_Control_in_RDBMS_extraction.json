      "abstract": "Relational  Database  Management  Systems  (RDBMS)  are  foundational for structured  data management  across  various  domains,  making  their  security paramount,  especially  in  the  era  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI).  This  paper  proposes an  AI-Driven  Access  Control  (AI-DAC)  framework  that  integrates  machine  learning  (ML),  reinforcement  learning  (RL),  and  metaheuristic  algorithms  to  enhance data  access  control  in  RDBMS.  The  framework  is  designed  to  dynamically  adapt  to evolving  security  threats,  providing  a  robust,  multi-layered  approach  that  includes diagnostic,  corrective,  and  generative  loops.  The  AI-DAC  framework's  effectiveness  is  validated  through  comprehensive  experimental  studies  and  real-world  case analyses,  demonstrating  its  capability  to  optimize  access  control  policies,  reduce unauthorized  access,  and  ensure  high  security  in  RDBMS  environments.",
