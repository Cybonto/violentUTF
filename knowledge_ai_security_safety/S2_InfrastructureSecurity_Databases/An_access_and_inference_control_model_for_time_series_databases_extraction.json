      "description": "The paper presents a methodological framework for addressing security requirements of time series data applications. The framework includes a discretionary access control model with the capability of preventing information inference in time series data. It is composed of five primitive components: Subjects, Objects, Access Modes, Value Constraints, and Temporal Constraints. These components are used to define and express authorization rules. The model also investigates different types of conflicts between authorization rules and proposes different approaches for conflict resolution. The paper includes a detailed analysis of security issues in time series data, a formal definition of time series data, and a motivating example to elaborate on the security requirements. The proposed model is evaluated through implementation as a secure access layer over a time series database, and the overhead of the access control procedure on the performance of the database is measured.",
