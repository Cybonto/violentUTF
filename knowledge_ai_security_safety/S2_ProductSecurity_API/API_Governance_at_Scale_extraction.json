      "abstract": "API Governance, the process of applying standardized sets of policies and guardrails to the design and development of APIs, has only grown in importance and prominence given the continued growth in APIs being produced. In this paper, we present an Action Research style approach to investigate and understand the utility of a multi-faceted API Governance process being adopted inside Google. We first reflect on past research around API Governance, and then introduce three new components, 1. API Improvement Proposals (AIPs) the documented source of truth for API design rules, 2. API Linter, an automated analysis tool which checks for adherence to / violations of AIPs, and 3. API Readability, a program to educate and certify API design experts. These three components are designed to build upon pre-existing processes to scale and improve API design. Through a mixed-methods research strategy, containing both a survey and a series of interviews, we evaluate the utility of these approaches in supporting API Producers. Our research shows that API Producers have positive sentiment towards API Governance, validating the general direction of the program. Specifically, our study participants highlighted the positive impact of API Governance on the quality of the APIs they produced, via consistency in both the outcome and approach. This paper also discusses future research opportunities to enhance API Governance, specifically with regards to newer API Producers, who reported worse sentiment towards the program than their more experienced peers.\n\n## CCS Concepts\n\n· Software and its engineering → Software development methods ; Software design engineering .\n\n## Keywords\n\nAPI governance, API design\n\n## ACMReference Format:\n\nMak Ahmad, JJ Geewax, Andrew Macvean, David Karger, and Kwan-Liu Ma. 2024.

The study focuses on three new components of API Governance: API Improvement Proposals (AIPs), an API Linter, and the API Readability program. The methodology includes a mixed-methods research strategy, combining quantitative data from the survey with qualitative insights from the interviews.",
