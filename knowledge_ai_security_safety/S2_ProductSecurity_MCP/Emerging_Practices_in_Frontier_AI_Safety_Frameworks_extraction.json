      "abstract": "As part of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments agreed to at the 2024 AI Seoul Summit, many AI developers agreed to publish a safety framework outlining how they will manage potential severe risks associated with their systems. This paper summarises current thinking from companies, governments, and researchers on how to write an effective safety framework. We outline three core areas of a safety framework - risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation, and governance - and identify emerging practices within each area. As safety frameworks are novel and rapidly developing, we hope that this paper can serve both as an overview of work to date and as a starting point for further discussion and innovation.",

      "description": "This paper presents a structured approach to summarizing and analyzing the emerging practices in AI safety frameworks as agreed upon in the Frontier AI Safety Commitments at the 2024 AI Seoul Summit. The methodological framework involves organizing the research according to three core areas of AI safety frameworks: risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation, and governance. Within each area, components of a safety framework are identified, and within each component, emerging practices are detailed. The paper draws on published safety frameworks, literature and standards on frontier AI risk management, internal research by the UK AI Safety Institute, and the Frontier AI Safety Commitments themselves. The practices identified go beyond what is included in published safety frameworks and include suggestions by researchers for novel practices developers could adopt.",
