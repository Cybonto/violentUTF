      "abstract": "Firewalls are effective in preventing attacks initiated from outside of an organization's network, but they are vulnerable to external threats, e.g. ransomware attacks may expose sensitive firewall data to malicious entities or disable network protection from the firewall. In this paper, we present Obliv-FW: a novel distributed architecture and a suite of protocols to obliviously manage and evaluate firewall rules and policies to prevent external attacks oriented to the firewall data. Obliv-FW alleviates this issue by obfuscating the blacklist or whitelist and distributing the function of evaluating these lists across multiple servers residing in different access control zones of the organization's internal network. Thus, both accessing and altering the rules are considerably more difficult thereby providing better protection to the local network as well as greater security for the firewall itself. Obliv-FW is developed by leveraging the existing secure multi-party computation techniques. Our empirical results show that the overhead of Obliv-FW is small, and it can be a very valuable tool to mitigate the ever-increasing threats to a private network from external attacks including ransomware attacks.",
