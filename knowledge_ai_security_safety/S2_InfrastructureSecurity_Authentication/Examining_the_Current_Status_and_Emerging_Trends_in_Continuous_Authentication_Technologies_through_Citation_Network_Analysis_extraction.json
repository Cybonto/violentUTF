      "abstract": "Continuous Authentication (CA) technologies enable users to be authenticated beyond just the point of entry. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of over 2,300 articles to (a) identify the main components of CA research to date, and (b) explore the current gaps and future research directions. Through a Citation Network Analysis (CNA), we identified that there are currently three primary focus research areas on CA Keystroke Dynamics; Mouse Movements; and Mobile Device Touch, as well as identify an emerging trend in more recent studies on multi-modal CA authentication which utilises the numerous sensors that are embedded in modern mobile devices. This study also highlights the current gaps in the literature such as the need for a consensus over how to evaluate the application and utility of CA, and the need to examine the feasibility of CA technologies that currently exist based on more use case studies.",
