      "abstract": "In this paper, we will discuss the challenges of Financial-grade API, focusing on prevention mechanisms for 'Cuckoo's Token Attack' and delve into the current security authentication mechanisms of OAuth 2.0, Financial-grade API 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Finally, we found that the OpenID Connect method can mitigate the attack by using a one-time token and issuer identifier, but a one-time authentication method without the OpenID Connect requirement is also needed.",
