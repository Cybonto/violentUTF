      "abstract": "Quantum computers pose a significant threat to widely used public-key cryptosystems, endangering current authentication and authorization systems. This paper presents a post-quantum Single Sign-On (SSO) solution that integrates Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, specifically MLDSA and ML-KEM, for authentication and authorization. The proposed system demonstrates a 90% improvement in token generation speed post-migration from traditional cryptosystems and a 331% increase in key-storage speed when storing PQC keys using a novel vector database mechanism. Additionally, an enhanced risk-based authentication model is developed, achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting risky logins, surpassing existing models. These contributions offer a comprehensive, efficient, and secure SSO system resistant to quantum attacks, addressing the limitations of current systems that do not fully integrate PQC algorithms or optimized key storage solutions.",

Additionally, the accuracy of the risk-based authentication model was evaluated using AUC scores."

The mutual challenge-response authentication completed in 140 ± 20 microseconds, which is faster than RSA. The ML-DSA-based JWT tokens demonstrated a 90% improvement in token generation speed over RSA and a 60% faster token verification speed than ED25519. The risk-based authentication model achieved a 98% accuracy in detecting risky logins."
