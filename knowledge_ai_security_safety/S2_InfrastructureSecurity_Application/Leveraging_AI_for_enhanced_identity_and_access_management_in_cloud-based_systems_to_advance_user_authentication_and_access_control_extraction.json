      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of cloud computing has transformed modern businesses, enabling scalable, efficient, and flexible operations. However, it has also introduced new security challenges, particularly in identity and access management (IAM). The traditional IAM models are increasingly being replaced or enhanced by AI-driven approaches that promise improved authentication, authorization, and access control. This paper delves into the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing IAM in cloud environments, exploring AI's potential to strengthen security, enhance user experience, and support regulatory compliance. With a comprehensive review of AI methodologies, case studies, challenges, and future directions, this study provides a roadmap for organizations seeking to harness AI for secure and efficient IAM in the cloud.\n\nKeywords: Cloud computing; Business; Identity and access management; Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity",
