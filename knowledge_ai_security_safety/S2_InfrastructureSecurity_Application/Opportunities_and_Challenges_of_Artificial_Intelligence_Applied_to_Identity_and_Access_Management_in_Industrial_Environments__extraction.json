      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence(AI) technologies into identity and access management (IAM) systems has greatly improved access control and management, offering more robust, adaptive, and intelligent solutions than traditional methods. AI-driven IAM systems enhance security, operational efficiency, and introduce new capabilities in industrial environments. In this narrative review, we present the state-of-the-art AI technologies in industrial IAM, focusing on methods such as biometric, comprising facial and voice recognition, and multifactor authentication for robust security. It addresses the challenges and solutions in implementing AI-based IAM systems in industrial settings, including security, privacy, evaluation, and continuous improvement. We present also the emerging trends and future directions, highlighting AI's potential to transform industrial security measures. This review aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing next-generation access control systems, proposing future research directions to address challenges and optimize AI applications in this domain.",
