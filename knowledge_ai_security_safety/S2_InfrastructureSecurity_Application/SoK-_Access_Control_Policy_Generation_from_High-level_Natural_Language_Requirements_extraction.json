The SLR follows a scientific and reproducible approach, structured into two main stages: planning the review and conducting the review. The planning stage involves defining the research scope, formulating research questions, developing search strings, selecting data sources, and defining study selection criteria. The conducting stage includes research identification and study selection, data extraction, and data analysis.",
