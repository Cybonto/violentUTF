# ViolentUTF Database Discovery Automation - Additional Requirements
# Issue #279: Automated Discovery Scripts Development
#
# These are optional dependencies for enhanced discovery functionality.
# The core discovery system works without these, but full functionality requires them.
#
# Installation: pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
# Test dependencies: python3 test_requirements.py
#
# Core functionality (no dependencies): python3 test_discovery_basic.py
# Full functionality (with dependencies): python3 run_discovery.py run
