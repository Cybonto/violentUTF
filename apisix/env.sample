# apisix/env.sample

# --- ETCD Configuration ---
# For local development, allowing no authentication for etcd can simplify setup.
# For production, this MUST be "no" and proper authentication configured.
# If set to "no", ensure ETCD_USER/ETCD_PASSWORD are set and APISIX's config.yaml is updated accordingly.
# The setup script currently does NOT automatically configure ETCD with these passwords or update APISIX config for ETCD auth.
ETCD_ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION=yes
# ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_strong_etcd_root_password
# ETCD_USER=apisix_etcd_user
# ETCD_PASSWORD=your_strong_apisix_etcd_password


# --- APISIX Admin API Key ---
# This key is used to authenticate with the APISIX Admin API.
# If APISIX_ADMIN_KEY is commented out, empty, or set to "edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1",
# the setup script will generate a new secure key and update this file (if permissions allow) and apisix/conf/config.yaml.
# APISIX_ADMIN_KEY=edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1


# --- APISIX Dashboard Configuration ---
# The dashboard needs to know the APISIX address and the admin key to communicate.
# These will be injected into apisix/conf/dashboard-conf.yaml by the setup script.
APISIX_SERVER_ADMIN_API_URL=http://apisix:9180/apisix/admin
# The APISIX_ADMIN_KEY from above will be used here too.


# --- Grafana Credentials (Optional - uncomment and set if you want the script to manage them) ---
# GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin
# GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_strong_grafana_password
